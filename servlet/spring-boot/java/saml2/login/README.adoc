= SAML 2.0 Login & Logout Sample

This guide provides instructions on setting up this SAML 2.0 Login & Logout sample application.
It uses https://simplesamlphp.org/[SimpleSAMLphp] as its asserting party.

The sample application uses Spring Boot and the `spring-security-saml2-service-provider`
module which is new in Spring Security 5.2.

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/logout.html[SAML 2.0 Logout feature] is new in Spring Security 5.6.

== Goals

=== SAML 2.0 Login

`saml2Login()` provides a very simple implementation of a Service Provider that can receive a SAML 2.0 Response via the HTTP-POST and HTTP-REDIRECT bindings against the https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/main/[Okta SAML 2.0 IDP] reference implementation.

The following features are implemented in the MVP:

1. Receive and validate a SAML 2.0 Response containing an assertion, and create a corresponding authentication in Spring Security
2. Send a SAML 2.0 AuthNRequest to an Identity Provider
3. Provide a framework for components used in SAML 2.0 authentication that can be swapped by configuration
4. Work against the SimpleSAMLPHP reference implementation

=== SAML 2.0 Single Logout

`saml2Logout()` supports RP- and AP-initiated SAML 2.0 Single Logout via the HTTP-POST and HTTP-REDIRECT bindings against the https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/saml2/main/[Okta SAML 2.0 IDP] reference implementation.

On this sample, the SAML 2.0 Logout is using the HTTP-POST binding.

You can refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/logout.html[reference documentation] for more details about the RP- and AP-initiated SAML 2.0 Logout.

== Run the Sample

=== Prerequisites

This sample requires Docker in order to stand up the identity provider.
If you don't have Docker, you can alternatively disable Docker in `application.yml` and stand up your own IdP.

=== Start up the Sample Boot Application
```
 ./gradlew :servlet:spring-boot:java:saml2:login:bootRun
```

=== Open a Browser

http://localhost:8080/

You will be redirected to a chooser page where you can pick between one of two identity providers.

=== Type in your credentials

```
User: user1
Password: user1pass
```
